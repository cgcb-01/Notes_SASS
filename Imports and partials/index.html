        <h2>SO, What is the use of IMPORTS AND PARTIALS?</h2>
        <br>
        <h5>HAVE YOU EVER USED #include in c and import in java- They have nothing but built in functions that we use again and again............ SAME HERE</h5>

    <p> <b><br><br></b>1. Sass Helps us to use a same functions again and again . The use of Partials is same as use of header files in c.<br> We can define styles and coponents and save it in a folder or in a file and can import and use it again and again thus reduces time and improves efficiency.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p> Here I have resets.css where I defines the flex property of the body and the margin and padding of the full web page it is imported in the style.scss and it does its actions.</p>
